# Searching the CPD

## Searching

Start a database search from the CPD homepage by clicking "Search Database" or going to https://cpd.chemcatbio.org/search_database.

### Add Search Criteria

Add criteria to your search by clicking the "Add Criterion" button. Select the criterion you want using the "Select a criterion" dropdown. See the [CPD Quick Guide](https://cpd.chemcatbio.org/parameter-guide) or [Parameter Guide](/parameter-guide) section of this site for an explanation of each parameter that can be added as a search criterion.

_Example of adding an Adsorbate="HNOH" search criterion:_
TODO: add_criterion

For many criteria, such as Adsorbate, you can continue adding multiple entries from the dropdown list. The CPD will return results matching ANY of the entries entered within a single criterion.
